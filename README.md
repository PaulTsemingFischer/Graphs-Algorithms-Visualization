Graph. A Data Structure with Algorithm's project co-authored by ___

Part 1: Graph Implementation
-
_A graph data structure in Kotlin using an adjacency matrix_

Features:
- _Core graph functionality_
- _Pathing algorithms including Dijkstra's_
- _Unfinished coloring algorithm that definitely doesn't work_
- _Highly Connected Subgraph clustering algorithm_
- _Graph Randomization including clustered randomization_  

Part 2: Graphics Implementation
-
_A visual, interactive representation of our graph using JavaFX_

Features:
- _Visualize and move vertices that make the graph easy to see_
- _Run algorithms and see the results in real time_
- _PHYSICS SIMULATION! Turn on physics to watch the graph move around the screen forming 'natural' clusters and spreading across the screen_
